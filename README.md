# Minesweeper

This is a Minesweeper project that I used to help learn the fundamentals of C++. The game fully runs from the terminal and takes similar input to the format that chess uses. 

I rewrote the code for this project in C# using Unity to make a fully graphical version: https://github.com/BradG13531/GMinesweeper

To play the terminal based Minesweeper, the executable is located under "Releases" for Mac. I recommend however downloading the source code and running the executable from there. It is located in the 'build' folder and is called 'Minesweeper'. You might need to Control click and open with a terminal if your computer marks it as unsafe.

Another option is to download the source code and build it yourself.

Controls:
- To reveal a cell, enter the column letter and the row number:
  - A6
- To place or remove a flag, enter the column letter and row number followed by an 'f':
  - A6f
