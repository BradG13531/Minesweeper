# Minesweeper

This is a Minesweeper project that I used to help learn the fundamentals of C++. The game fully runs from the terminal and takes similar input to the format that chess uses. 

The executable is located under "Releases" for Mac.

Controls:
- To reveal a cell, enter the column letter and the row number:
  - A6
- To place or remove a flag, enter the column letter and row number followed by an 'f':
  - A6f
